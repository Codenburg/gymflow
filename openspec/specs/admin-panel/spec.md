# Admin Panel Specification

## Purpose

This spec defines the requirements and behavior for the Admin Panel feature of the gym-routines-manager application.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: Authentication System

The system MUST provide a secure authentication system using Better Auth with DNI/password login.

#### Scenario: Admin Login

- GIVEN the admin is on the login page at `/admin/login`
- WHEN the admin enters valid credentials
- THEN the admin is redirected to the dashboard
- AND a session cookie is set

#### Scenario: Invalid Credentials

- GIVEN the admin is on the login page
- WHEN the admin enters invalid credentials
- THEN an error message is displayed
- AND the admin remains on the login page

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated Access

- GIVEN an unauthenticated user tries to access `/admin/*`
- THEN the user is redirected to `/admin/login`

---

### Requirement: Authorization

The system MUST verify admin role for all administrative actions.

#### Scenario: Non-admin Access

- GIVEN an authenticated user without admin role tries to access `/admin/*`
- THEN the user is redirected to the home page

#### Scenario: Server Action Access

- GIVEN a user calls a server action without admin session
- THEN the action returns `{ success: false, message: "No tienes permisos de administrador" }`

---

### Requirement: Dashboard

The admin dashboard MUST display statistics and quick actions.

#### Scenario: View Dashboard

- GIVEN an authenticated admin visits `/admin`
- THEN the dashboard displays:
  - Total number of routines
  - Total number of days
  - Total number of exercises
  - Quick action buttons
  - Recent routines list

---

### Requirement: CRUD Operations

Admins MUST be able to create, read, update, and delete routines, days, and exercises.

#### Scenario: Create Routine

- GIVEN an authenticated admin visits `/admin/rutinas/new`
- WHEN the admin fills the form and submits
- THEN a new routine is created
- AND the admin is redirected to the routines list

- THEN the routine is updated
- AND the changes are reflected immediately

#### Scenario: Delete Routine

- GIVEN an authenticated admin is on the routine edit page
- WHEN the admin clicks delete
- THEN the routine is permanently deleted
- AND the admin is redirected to the routines list

---

### Requirement: Day Management

Admins MUST be able to manage days within routines.

#### Scenario: Add Day

- GIVEN an authenticated admin is editing a routine
- WHEN the admin adds a new day
- THEN the day is created with auto-generated order

#### Scenario: Delete Day

- THEN all exercises in that day are also deleted (cascade)

---

### Requirement: Exercise Management

Admins MUST be able to manage exercises within days.

#### Scenario: Add Exercise

- GIVEN an authenticated admin is on the day detail page
- WHEN the admin adds a new exercise
- THEN the exercise is created with auto-generated order

#### Scenario: Reorder Exercises

- GIVEN an authenticated admin is on the day detail page
- WHEN the admin drags exercises to reorder
- THEN the order is saved to the database
- AND the UI updates immediately

---

### Requirement: Input Validation

All inputs MUST be validated server-side using Zod.

#### Scenario: Invalid UUID

- GIVEN an admin submits a form with invalid UUID
- THEN the server returns validation error
- AND the error is displayed to the admin

#### Scenario: Invalid JSON in Reorder

- GIVEN an admin triggers reorder with malformed JSON
- THEN the server returns "Formato de IDs inválido"
- AND no 500 error occurs

---

### Requirement: Security

The system MUST implement security best practices.

#### Scenario: Session Handling

- GIVEN a user logs in
- THEN the session is managed via HTTP-only cookies
- AND the client does NOT store session in localStorage

#### Scenario: Protected Routes

- GIVEN an unauthenticated user tries to access `/admin/*` except `/admin/login`
- THEN the user is redirected to login
- AND the original URL is preserved for redirect after login

---

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- **Library**: Better Auth v1.5.4
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Session**: HTTP-only cookies (7 days expiry)

### Authorization
- **Middleware**: Verifies session and admin role
- **Server Actions**: Each action calls verifyAdmin()

### State Management
- **Client State**: Zustand (in-memory, no persistence)
- **Server State**: Server Components with revalidatePath

### Validation
- **Library**: Zod v4
- **Validation Points**: Form submission, API parameters

### API Layers
1. **Middleware**: Route protection
2. **Server Actions**: Business logic with auth
3. **Public API**: Read-only endpoints

---

### Requirement: Gym Price Configuration (FormState + useActionState)

Admins MUST be able to view and edit the gym subscription price. The server action MUST return `FormState<T>` and the component MUST use `useActionState` (React 19). On successful save, a toast notification MUST be displayed.

#### Scenario: Display current price

- GIVEN The admin page loads
- WHEN The component fetches from GET /api/gym
- THEN The current price MUST be displayed in a readable format (e.g., "$45.000")

#### Scenario: Loading state

- GIVEN The admin page is loading
- WHEN The API request is in flight
- THEN A loading skeleton or spinner MUST be displayed

#### Scenario: Enter edit mode

- GIVEN The admin user is viewing the price display
- WHEN The user clicks the "Editar precio" button
- THEN The display MUST change to a numeric input field
- AND The current price MUST be pre-filled in the input

#### Scenario: Cancel edit

- GIVEN The user is in edit mode with unsaved changes
- WHEN The user clicks a cancel button
- THEN The input MUST be discarded
- AND The original price MUST be displayed again

#### Scenario: Save new price with success toast

- GIVEN The user is in edit mode with a valid new price
- WHEN The user clicks "Guardar"
- THEN The server action MUST be called with `useActionState`
- AND On success, the display MUST update with the new price
- AND The component MUST exit edit mode
- AND A toast success notification MUST be displayed: "Precio actualizado exitosamente"

#### Scenario: Save with validation error

- GIVEN The user is in edit mode with invalid input (less than 1000, more than 500000, or more than 2 decimal places)
- WHEN The user clicks "Guardar"
- THEN A validation error message MUST be displayed below the input
- AND The request MUST NOT complete

#### Scenario: Save with server error

- GIVEN The user is in edit mode with valid input
- WHEN The server action returns an error
- THEN A toast error notification MUST be displayed with the error message
- AND The component MUST remain in edit mode

#### Scenario: Price formatting

- GIVEN The price value is 45000
- WHEN The price is rendered for display
- THEN It MUST be displayed as "$45.000" (peso sign, thousand separator)

#### Scenario: Input sync with server state

- GIVEN The user is in edit mode
- WHEN The server action returns a new price (e.g., after another user edited)
- THEN The input MUST resync using `key={serverPrice}` to force re-mount

#### Scenario: Second consecutive edit shows toast

- GIVEN The user just completed an edit and the form closed
- WHEN The user clicks "Editar precio" again and saves
- THEN A toast MUST be displayed (the useEffect dependency on isPending ensures this fires every time)

### Component Specification

#### Gym Price Editor Component

**Location**: `src/components/admin/GymPriceEditor.tsx`

**Architecture**: Uses React 19 `useActionState` with the `updateGymPrice` server action.

**State Management**:
- Server state: `useActionState(updateGymPrice, initialState)` returns `[state, formAction, isPending]`
- Local UI state: `useState(false)` for `isEditing`

**Input Sync Rule**: Inputs consuming server action data MUST use either:
1. Controlled: `value={state.data?.x}` + `onChange`
2. Uncontrolled with resync: `defaultValue={state.data?.x}` + `key={state.data?.x}`

**Toast Pattern**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isPending && state.success) {
    setIsEditing(false);
    toast.success("Precio actualizado exitosamente");
  }
}, [isPending, state.success]);
```

**Validation**: Zod schema enforces min 1000, max 500000, max 2 decimal places.

### Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| ACGP1 | `updateGymPrice` signature is `(prevState: FormState<{ price: number }>, formData: FormData)` |
| ACGP2 | `updateGymPrice` returns `FormState<{ price: number }>` |
| ACGP3 | GymPriceEditor uses `useActionState` instead of manual try/catch |
| ACGP4 | Zod validation rejects prices < 1000, > 500000, or > 2 decimals |
| ACGP5 | Toast appears on successful save (including second consecutive edit) |
| ACGP6 | Edit form closes after successful save |
| ACGP7 | Validation errors display below input without closing form |
| ACGP8 | Input uses `defaultValue` + `key={serverPrice}` for sync |

## Gym Configuration Admin Page

This section defines requirements for the admin gym configuration page and its navigation entry.

### Requirement: Admin Config Page Navigation

The admin sidebar MUST expose a "Configuración" (or equivalently named) nav item that links to `/admin/config`. The item MUST follow the existing visual conventions of other admin sidebar items and MUST be visible to all admin roles that have access to the gym configuration feature.

#### Scenario: Clicking the nav item navigates to the config page

- GIVEN an authenticated admin clicks the config nav item in the sidebar
- WHEN the navigation completes
- THEN the user MUST be on the `/admin/config` page
- AND the sidebar item MUST reflect the active route

### Requirement: Admin Config Form Layout

The `/admin/config` page MUST render a form organized into logical field groups, matching the existing `FormState<T>` + `useActionState` pattern used by `GymPriceEditor`. Each group MUST be independently submittable so an admin can save one section without re-validating the others.

#### Scenario: Config page renders all field groups

- GIVEN an authenticated admin visits `/admin/config`
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN a form MUST display input fields grouped as: Identity (nombre), Hours & Address (horario, direccion, mapsEmbedUrl), Social (socialInstagram, socialWhatsapp)
- AND each group MUST have its own "Guardar" button

#### Scenario: Inputs sync with server state

- GIVEN the Gym record is updated by another admin while the form is open
- WHEN the page re-fetches (e.g., after a save in another tab)
- THEN the input fields MUST re-sync with the latest server values
- AND the implementation MUST follow the controlled-or-key-resync rule from `react_rules.server_action_inputs` in `openspec/config.yaml`

#### Scenario: Validation errors display inline

- GIVEN an admin submits a group with invalid input (e.g., empty nombre, malformed URL)
- WHEN the server action returns a `FormState` with `errors`
- THEN the error message MUST be rendered near the offending input
- AND the form MUST remain in edit mode (not collapse or close)

#### Scenario: Success toast on save

- GIVEN an admin submits a group with valid input
- WHEN the server action returns `{ success: true }`
- THEN a success toast MUST be displayed (e.g., "Configuración actualizada")
- AND the page MUST reflect the new persisted values

### Requirement: Config Page Auth Integration

The `/admin/config` page MUST be protected by the same auth middleware that guards the rest of the admin panel. Unauthenticated users MUST be redirected to `/admin/login`. Non-admin users (role USER) MUST be redirected to the homepage. Trainer users (role TRAINER) MUST be redirected to `/admin/rutinas` per the existing RBAC rules.

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated redirect

- GIVEN no session exists
- WHEN a request to `/admin/config` is made
- THEN the user MUST be redirected to `/admin/login`

#### Scenario: Regular user blocked

- GIVEN a user with role USER is authenticated
- WHEN the user navigates to `/admin/config`
- THEN the user MUST be redirected to the homepage

### Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| ACGCA1 | The admin sidebar exposes a "Configuración" nav item linking to `/admin/config`, visible to admins only |
| ACGCA2 | `/admin/config` renders 4 sub-form groups: Identity, Hours & Address, Social, each with its own "Guardar" button |
| ACGCA3 | Inputs use the controlled-or-key-resync pattern (`value` + `onChange`, or `defaultValue` + `key={serverValue}`) to avoid desync |
| ACGCA4 | Inline validation errors render near offending input; form stays in edit mode on error |
| ACGCA5 | A success toast is displayed on `FormState.success === true`; page reflects the new persisted values |
| ACGCA6 | Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/admin/login`; USER role → homepage; TRAINER role → `/admin/rutinas` |
