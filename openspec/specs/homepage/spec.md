# Homepage UI Specification

## Purpose

This specification defines the behavior and requirements for the gym routines manager homepage MVP. The homepage displays a list of available workout routines with basic search functionality, providing users with their first interaction point with the application.

## Data Model

The system MUST use the following Prisma schema for the `Rutina` model:

```prisma
model Rutina {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  nombre      String
  tipo        String
  descripcion String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  dias        Dia[]
}

model Dia {
  id                String     @id @default(uuid())
  rutinaId          String
  nombre            String
  musculosEnfocados String?
  orden             Int        @default(0)
  createdAt         DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime   @updatedAt
  rutina            Rutina     @relation(fields: [rutinaId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  ejercicios        Ejercicio[]
}
```

---

## API Endpoint Requirements

### Requirement: GET /api/rutinas Endpoint

The system SHALL provide a REST API endpoint at `GET /api/rutinas` that returns a list of routines from the database.

The endpoint MUST accept an optional `search` query parameter for filtering routines by name.

#### Scenario: Fetch all routines without search filter

- GIVEN the database contains at least one Rutina record
- WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/rutinas` without query parameters
- THEN the response status code SHALL be 200

- AND each Rutina object SHALL include `id`, `nombre`, `tipo`, `descripcion`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`

#### Scenario: Filter routines by search query

- GIVEN the database contains routines with names "Rutina A", "Rutina B", and "Rutina C"
- WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/rutinas?search=Rutina%20A"
- THEN the response status code SHALL be 200
- AND the response body SHALL contain only routines whose `nombre` field contains the search term (case-insensitive)
- AND routines that do not match the search term SHALL NOT be included in the response

#### Scenario: Empty search results

- GIVEN the database contains no routines with "nonexistent" in the name
- WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/rutinas?search=nonexistent"
- THEN the response status code SHALL be 200

#### Scenario: Search with empty string

- GIVEN the database contains at least one Rutina record
- WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/api/rutinas?search="
- THEN the response SHALL behave as if no search filter was provided
- AND all routines SHALL be returned

#### Scenario: Database connection failure

- GIVEN the database is unavailable or connection fails

## Technical Implementation Notes (Not Part of Spec)

The following are implementation guidance and are NOT requirements:

- Server Components fetch data directly without useEffect
- use() hook consumes async promises in components
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- URL searchParams used for search state
- next/navigation for client-side navigation
